# Olympic games from Athens 1896 to Rio2016 Analysis using Excel

## Scenario

An international Judo club is looking for new ways to leverage data for competition. One idea they have had is to use past competition data to estimate the threat of future opponents. They have provided  a dataset of past Olympic data and want to know whether usage of information such as the height, weight and age of a judo competito is possible to estimate the probability that they will earn a medal.

## Data Analysis Process

The data analysis process used is the following:

1- Ask:

    1- What is the probability of a judo athlete to win a medal based on height ?

    2- What is the probability of a judo athlete to win a medal based on weight ?

    3- What is the probability of a judo player to win a medal based on age ?

2- Prepare: The data set has been collected from ![dataset_suource](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results) which is a consolidated version of data from ![original_unconsolidated_source](https://www.sports-reference.com/) under the following ![license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)

3- Process: Cleaning, transforming and organizing the raw data to make it suitable for analysis. Handling of missing values, addressing outliers, and performing any necessary data manipulations to ensure data is in a usable form for subsequent analytical steps.

4- Analyze: Sorting and filtering data in a way to gain insights. In this analysis I focused on three things:

    1- Getting insight on the relation between height and number of medal acquired.

    2- Determining the reation between weight and number of medals obtained.

    3- Investigating the relation between age and number of medals gained.

5-  Share: Using the insgihts gained in the analysis process, visualizations were created to be shared in my report.
