# Cyclistic bike-share data analysis using python

## Scenario

The director of marketing of a fictional bike-share company in Chicago believes the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, an understanding of the difference between casual members and annual members in their usage of Cyclistic bikes. From these insights, a new marketing strategy will be designed to convert casual riders into annual members.

## Data analysis process

The data analysis process used is the following:

1- Ask: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
        Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
        How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
        
2- Prepare: Usage of Cyclisticâ€™s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. Data of previous 12 months was used(Note: The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic
is a fictional company. For the purposes of this case study, the datasets are appropriate and
will enable me to answer the business questions. The data has been made available by
Motivate International Inc. under this license //insert link.)

3- Process: Cleaning, transforming and organizing the raw data to make it suitable for analysis. Handling of missing values, addressing outliers, and performing any necessary data manipulations to ensure data is in a usable form for subsequent analytical steps.

4- Analyze: Sorting and filtering data in a way to gain insights. In this analysis I focused on three things:
1- The prefered type of bike each type (annual member/casual) used.
2- The preffered routes by each type.
3- The time of the day each type uses the bikes most.

From these things, we can gain insight into the differences between the casual and annual members.

5- Share: Using the insgihts gained in the analysis process, visualizations were created to be shared in my report (remember to add insights and what visualizations you plotted)

6- Act: Recommendation for designing marketing strategy:
